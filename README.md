# CompassCal
A app to easily see your Compass Callendar on the desktop


Havn't you gotten tierd of opening your browser, navagating to Compass and loging in just to see what you have next session? Well i sought to fix this problen and came up with a nice and minamilistic python application that shows your daliy timetable.   

![What it looks like. Woo Hoo, No School!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122259384/221346122-5f9f7213-b39a-49a9-bc2e-f8f23cb5de7e.png)


All you have to do is download the provided CompassCal.exe file to a folder in your documents folder.

Upon opening it for the first time, paste your Compass Sync My Schedule link into the textbox ( Ctrl + v ) and press submit. Be aware that it will create a logins.txt file in the same folder that CompassCal.exe was placed in.

It will then take you to the main program where it shows you timetable in a small window.
